## Filing issues

Feature requests, bugs, questions or other comments should be filed as an issue. These are welcome and appreciated.
Please try to include as much relevant information as possible in the issue.

## Contributing

Any contributions are welcome - if not source code, then certainly testing, documentation or any other contribution is welcome.
Pull requests should be high quality (this is going into live, production servers) and conform to standard C# guidelines.
Needless to say, any warnings or hints in all code must be resolved.

Thanks :)
